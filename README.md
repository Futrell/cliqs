# Crosslinguistic Investigations in Quantitative Syntax (CLIQS)

This is code for studying quantitative syntax using dependency corpora.

It is written for Python 3.5, and seems to work in Python 2.7 also, but I can't guarantee it.

### Dependencies

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` for basic functionality.
Additionally, run `pip install -r optrequirements.txt` for optional dependencies used for parallelization and visualization.
