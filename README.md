# Crosslinguistic Investigations in Quantitative Syntax (CLIQS)

This is code for studying quantitative syntax using dependency corpora.

It is written for Python 3.5, and seems to work in Python 2.7 also, but I can't guarantee it.

### Dependencies

These Python packages are needed for basic functionality.

1. `networkx`
2. `nose`
3. `pyrsistent`
4. `requests`

#### Optional dependencies:

These python packages enable some functions for parallelization and visualization.

1. `pandas`
2. `nxpd`
3. `ipyparallel`
4. `cloudpickle`
5. `sh`
